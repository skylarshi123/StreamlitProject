# Personality Cluster Analysis

## Description
This Streamlit application performs cluster analysis on personality traits based on user responses to a questionnaire. It uses the Big Five personality traits model (Extraversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness) to categorize users into clusters and provide insights into their personality profile.

## Features
- Interactive questionnaire with 50 personality-related questions
- Country selection for demographic information
- Dynamic clustering using Agglomerative Clustering
- Visualization of optimal cluster number using the Elbow Method
- Personal trait score calculation and interpretation
- Cluster assignment for user responses
- Comparison of user's traits with cluster characteristics
- Identification of the most representative country for each cluster

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personality-cluster-analysis.git
   cd personality-cluster-analysis
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Use the sidebar to select the number of clusters for the analysis

4. Fill out the questionnaire by adjusting the sliders for each question

5. Select your country from the dropdown menu

6. Click the "Submit" button to see your results

## Data
The application uses a dataset named "Personality_test.csv" located at "/Users/skylarshi/Documents/Streamlit/Personality_test.csv". Ensure this file is present and contains the necessary data for the analysis.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The app loads and preprocesses the personality test data, encoding country information.
2. Clustering: Agglomerative Clustering is applied to group similar personality profiles.
3. User Input: The app collects user responses to the personality questionnaire.
4. Cluster Prediction: The user's responses are used to predict which cluster they belong to.
5. Trait Analysis: The app calculates and interprets the user's scores for each personality trait.
6. Comparison: The user's traits are compared with the characteristics of their assigned cluster.

## Interpretation of Results
- Trait Scores: Ranging from 0 to 5, interpreted as Low (0-2), Average (2-3), High (3-4), or Very High (4-5).
- Cluster Assignment: Indicates which group of similar personality profiles the user belongs to.
- Cluster Characteristics: Shows the average trait scores for the assigned cluster.
- Representative Country: Identifies the country most commonly associated with the user's cluster.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- The current version uses a limited dataset (1000 rows). Expanding the dataset could improve accuracy.
- The clustering algorithm and number of clusters are fixed. Future versions could allow for more dynamic selection of clustering methods.
- The country representation might not be globally balanced. Improving geographic diversity in the dataset could enhance this feature.
